# javaPractice
This is a repository to record my Java code practice and learning journey.
I upload any of the small programs and projects that I have used to learn new concepts or just reviewing concepts to this repository.
The purpose is to learn and review Java concepts.
My actual prroject files will be in different repositories that are dedicated to the specific project.
